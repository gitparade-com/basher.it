[basherpm/basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) is one of the best package managers for the bash scripting language. `basher` allows you to use bash packages in the simplest way:
```bash
# install a new package and use it right away
$ basher install <author>/<package>

# uninstall a package
$ basher uninstall <author>/<package>

# update a package to the latest version
$ basher upgrade <author>/<package>

# update all package to the latest version
$ basher upgrade --all

# list all installed packages
$ basher list
                     
# list all upgradeable packages
$ basher outdated
```

## Example

```shell
$ basher install pforret/note
Cloning into '$HOME/.basher/cellar/packages/pforret/note'...
(...)

# the script is immediately available as a new command-line tool
$ note
