> [**basher**](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) helps you quickly install, uninstall and update **bash packages** from the command line, in the same way `composer` does for PHP packages, `npm` for node.js packages, `apt` for Linux tools.

## Easy install of bash packages

```shell
$ basher install pforret/note
# that's it! 
# the bash script is installed and can be used immediately
```

* Check the [usage](/usage) for details on how to install/uninstall/update packages with `basher`.
